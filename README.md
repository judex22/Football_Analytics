# Who is the Next Harry Kane?
The project aims to predict a similar player to Harry Kane, a footballer of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club using the English Premier League 2020/21 season data.  Two approaches are used for the task that include using Visualizations and the other using the KNN machine learning technique.

This project was an inspiration from the learnings from the Mad About Sports Football Analytics Workshop conducted by Mr. Sushant Rao. The English Premier League (EPL) 2020/21 season dataset was downloaded from the FBref website where it is easily downloadable.

The plots that are not visible in the github file is provided in the 'The Next Harry Kane_Notebook.pdf' file.
